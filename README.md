starting a new project with the below objectives
- compile historical beach volleyball match statistics by scraping bvbinfo.com to start, with additional data sources added later
- create a dimensional model to allow for simple analysis
- create a powerBI dashboard for data analysis, imbed in a yet-to-be-created website

all this is subject to change :)
