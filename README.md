Starting a new project with the below objectives:
- Compile historical beach volleyball match statistics by scraping bvbinfo.com to start, with additional data sources added later
- Create a dimensional model to allow for simple analysis
- Create a powerBI dashboard for data analysis, imbed in a yet-to-be-created website

All this is subject to change :)
