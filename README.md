Starting a new project with the below objectives:
- Compile historical beach volleyball match statistics by scraping bvbinfo.com to start, with additional data sources added later
- Create a dimensional model to allow for simple analysis
- Create a user interface published on a webpage to interact with the data. Details very much TBD.

All this is subject to change :)
